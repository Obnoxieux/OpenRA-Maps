		Briefing: Transmission Received\n\nFrom; Allied High Command\n\nCommanders, you have both been selected by Allied High Command to carry out a surprise attack of utmost importance for our efforts to slow down the Soviet offensive. Our spies tell us that all Soviet operations are coordinated at the Forward Command Centre in this sector. If you could capture this structure, we would be informed about all Soviet plans, yielding us a significant advantage.\n\nYou should destroy the Soviet Radar first, then we will send you an MCV for base building.\n\nFurther optional tasks are the destruction of all Soviet naval and aerial threats in the sector.\n\nTransmission ends
